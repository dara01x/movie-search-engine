## 🏗️ Architecture & Algorithms

### Search Algorithm

- **Debounced Search**: 800ms delay prevents excessive API calls
- **Smart Caching**: Efficient state management for search results
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for network issues

### Trending Algorithm

The app implements a sophisticated trending system:

```javascript
// Trending calculation based on search frequency
Query.limit(5), // Top 5 most searched
  Query.orderDesc('count'); // Ordered by search count
```

1. **Data Collection**: Every search increments a counter for that movie
2. **Aggregation**: Movies are ranked by total search count
3. **Real-time Updates**: Trending list updates automatically
4. **Performance**: Limited to top 5 for optimal loading

### Data Flow Architecture

```
User Input → Debounce → API Call → State Update → UI Render
     ↓
Analytics Tracking → Appwrite Database → Trending Calculation
```
